# KPMG Data Analytics Internship Tasks

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the tasks I have completed during my Data Analytics internship at KPMG. This repository highlights my skills and expertise in performing data analysis, generating insights, and presenting findings.

## Task 1: 📊 Data Quality Assessment

In this task, I conducted a thorough assessment of the data quality to ensure accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability. I applied various techniques, such as data profiling, outlier detection, and data cleansing, to enhance the quality of the dataset. The task involved identifying and resolving data quality issues, ensuring the data is reliable for further analysis.

## Task 2: 📈 Data Insights

The second task focused on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset. Using exploratory data analysis techniques, statistical analysis, and data visualization, I uncovered patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. I used appropriate analytical methods to derive valuable insights that contribute to decision-making processes.

## Task 3: 🖥️ Data Presentation

In the third task, I prepared a comprehensive data presentation to effectively communicate the key findings and insights to stakeholders. I utilized data visualization techniques, storytelling approaches, and clear visual representations to convey the information in a concise and impactful manner. The presentation aimed to provide actionable insights and support strategic decision-making.
